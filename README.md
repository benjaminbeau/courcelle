### Flower is a Flowdock Bot

Flowdock is a team collaboration and group chat service, similar to Campfire.

Flowdock is also the group chat service of choice at the Mynewsdesk R&D dept. To make it more fun and/or usable, we made this bot.

Flower was made to be easy to extend with your own commands.

### How do I use it?

1. Copy and rename `config.yml.example` to `config.yml`, and fill it with your settings (especially the `api_token`)
2. Run the bot in the background: `rake run &` (or `foreman start`)
3. To stop the bot, kill the process
